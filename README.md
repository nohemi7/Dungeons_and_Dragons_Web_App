The main goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of the Model View Controller (MVC) paradigm in web development using  the Flask lightweight framework. I also used this to strengthenn my understanding of backend concepts such as HTTP requests and request handling. I also improved my implementation of front-end by leveraging bootstrap.
